# PORTFOLIO-CONSTRUCTION-AND-MANAGEMENT


A solo project of mine wherein I made use of Python and data analysis tools like Numpy ,Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn extensively to analyze market data and performed various statistical operations  to provide idea about the stock and the industry as a whole . I also constructed a portfolio of various stocks which I achieved by using the Efficient Frontier model and the Markowitz Optimization. Made use of bond allocation strategies along with PSP and GHP to construct optimized portfolios consisting of equities and bonds.
